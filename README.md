Wizard is ai at the speed of thought

A MacOS GPT wrapper designed to accelerate llm interaction. Wizard providing seamless, native integration into your desktop. It is built for speed.

- Features (in development):
  - Keybindgs for lightning-fast workflows
  - LLM model selection
  - FOSS business model - no subscription, no feature lock, no ads - Wizard is following in the footsteps of apps such as Apollo. If you wish to support our development we will treat you with goodies like seasonal skins, icons, and early access to new features. If you just want a free desktop GPT Wrapper that doesn't suck, all of the functionality of the app will be available to users for free and without sign-up. We are building this because a good free desktop GPT wrapper for MacOS doesn't exist, and we think that it should.
